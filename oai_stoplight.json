The condition value should be a string containing the id of a completed campaign. \n\nSegments may contain multiple condtions, joined by an \"and\" or \"or\" in the \"and_or\" field. The first condition in the conditions list must have an empty \"and_or\", and subsequent conditions must all specify an \"and_or\".\n\nThe Contacts API helps you manage your [Marketing Campaigns](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/index.html) recipients.\n\nFor more information about segments in Marketing Campaigns, please see our [User Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Marketing_Campaigns/lists.html#-Create-a-Segment).",

Whitelabeling a domain allows you to replace sendgrid.net with your personal sending domain. You will be required to create a subdomain so that SendGrid can generate the DNS records which you must give to your host provider. If you choose to use Automated Security, SendGrid will provide you with 3 CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security off, you will be given 2 TXT records and 1 MX record.\n\nFor more information on whitelabeling, please see our [User Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/Whitelabel/index.html)",

Use the \"username\" parameter. This allows you to create a whitelabel on behalf of your subuser. This means the subuser is able to see and modify the created whitelabel.\n2. Use the Association workflow (see Associate Domain section). This allows you to assign a whitelabel created by the parent to a subuser. This means the subuser will default to the assigned whitelabel, but will not be able to see or modify that whitelabel. However, if the subuser creates their own whitelabel it will overwrite the assigned whitelabel.\n\nA domain whitelabel allows you to remove the “via” or “sent on behalf of” message that your recipients see when they read your emails. Whitelabeling a domain allows you to replace sendgrid.net with your personal sending domain. You will be required to create a subdomain so that SendGrid can generate the DNS records which you must give to your host provider. If you choose to use Automated Security, SendGrid will provide you with 3 CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security off, you will be given 2 TXT records and 1 MX record.\n\nFor more information on whitelabeling, please see our [User Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/Whitelabel/index.html)",

Whitelabeling a domain allows you to replace sendgrid.net with your personal sending domain. You will be required to create a subdomain so that SendGrid can generate the DNS records which you must give to your host provider. If you choose to use Automated Security, SendGrid will provide you with 3 CNAME records. If you turn Automated Security off, you will be given 2 TXT records and 1 MX record.\n\nDomain whitelabels can be associated with (i.e. assigned to) subusers from a parent account. This functionality allows subusers to send mail using their parent's whitelabels. To associate a whitelabel with a subuser, the parent account must first create the whitelabel and validate it. The the parent may then associate the whitelabel via the subuser management tools.\n\nFor more information on whitelabeling, please see our [User Guide](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/Whitelabel/index.html)\n\n## URI Parameters\n| URI Parameter   | Type  | Description  |\n|---|---|---|\n| username | string  | Username of the subuser to find associated whitelabels for. |",

API Keys allow you to use another method of authentication separate from your account username and password. API Keys add an additional layer of security for your account and can be assigned [specific permissions](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API_v3/API_Keys/api_key_permissions_list.html) to limit which areas of your account they may be used to access. [API Keys can be generated in your account](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys). To use keys, you must set a plain text header named “Authorization” with the contents of the header being “Bearer XXX” where XXX is your API Secret Key.\n\n### Example Header\n\n```bash\nGET https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/resource HTTP/1.1\nAuthorization: Bearer Your.API.Key-HERE\n```\n\n```bash\ncurl -X \"GET\" \"https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/templates\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer Your.API.Key-HERE\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\n```",

                "content": "## Making a Request\n\n### Host\n\nThe host for Web API v3 requets is always `https://sendgrid.com/v3/`\n\n**All requests must be made over HTTPS. HTTP is not supported.**\n\n### Authorization Header\n\nYou must provide an authorization header as described in [Authentication]().\n\n### HTTP Verbs\n\n| **Verb** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- |\n| GET |  Retrieve a resource or gropu of resources |\n| POST| Create a new resource |\n| PUT | Update an existing resource |\n| DELTE | Delete an existing resource |\n| OPTIONS | View allowed verbs against a specific resource |\n\n### Accept Header\n\nThe API provides JSON responses. The [accept header](http://www.soapui.org/Best-Practices/understanding-rest-headers-and-parameters.html) is not currently required, though it may be required in the future. If not set, the API will use `application/json`.\n\n```bash\nGET https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/endpoint HTTP/1.1\nAccept: application/json\n```\n\n### Arrays of Data\n\nWhen you send an array of data in a `GET` request, you will include the parameter multiple times on the URL. We do not require that you add brackets to the parameter name.\n\n#### Example Array in a GET request\\\n\n```bash\nGET https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/endpoint?parameter=data1&parameter=data2 HTTP/1.1\n```\n\n## Formatting Your Request\n\n### Request Body\n\nWhen submitting data to a resource via `POST` or `PUT`, you must submit your payload in JSON.\n\n```bash\nPOST https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/templates/ HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/json\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"new template name\"\n}\n```\n\n### Pagination\n\nSome `GET` resources allow for retrieval of information in batches. We will provide the query args in the resource documentation when available to consume.\n\nWhen requesting multiple items, we will default the request limit to 500 items. You can specify a different limit but cannot not exceed the default limit.\n\nResources documented will display a bolded list of available paginated parameters if available.\n\nBelow is a basic pagination example. In the resource documentation, we will only provide the bolded list of available parameters.\n\n**When information is batched, a [Link Header](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988) will be provided in the response.**\n\n```bash\nGET https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/resource?limit=300&offset=10 HTTP/1.1\n```\n\n| **Parameter** | **Description** |\n|---|---|\n| limit | The number of records to return |\n| offset | The number of records to skip |\n\n### Search & Paramters\n\nSome resources allow for you to search by a specific field. Other resources require you ot append a paramter to the URI.\n\nIn this example, we will display a paginated URI example, searching for resources where the email contains `foo`.\n\n```bash\nGET https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/resource?email=foo&bar=baz HTTP/1.1\n```\n\n## Successful Requests\n\nBelow is a general overview of what resource objects are returned on successful Web API requets.\n\n| **Verb** | **Resource object returned** |\n|---|---|\n| GET | A single resoruce object or array of resource objects |\n| PATCH | The updated resource object is returned |\n| PUT | The updated resource object is returned |\n| DELETE | No content is returned |\n| POST | The newly created resource object is returned |",
