Once created, the Teammate's email address cannot be changed.\n\n### Scopes\n\nWhen creating a Teammate, you will assign it permissions or scopes. These scopes determine which actions the Teammate can perform and which features they can access. Scopes are provided with one of three properties passed to this endpoint: `is_admin`, `scopes`, and `persona`.\n\nYou can make a Teammate an administrator by setting `is_admin` to `true`. Administrators will have all scopes assigned to them. Alternatively, you can assign a `persona` to the teammate, which will assign them a block of permissions commonly required for that type of user. See the [**Personas** section of the **Teammate Permissions** page](https://www.twilio.com/docs/admin/pages/33354/edit/preview/#persona-scopes) for a list of permsissions granted by persona. Lastly, you can assign individual permissions with the `scopes` property. See the [**Teammate Permissions**](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/teammate-permissions) page for a full list of scopes that can be assigned to a Teammate.\n\n### Subuser access\n\nSendGrid Teammates may be assigned access to one or more Subusers. Subusers function like SendGrid sub-accounts with their own resources. See the [Subusers documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/subusers) for more information.\n\nWhen assigning Subuser access to a Teammate, you may set the `has_restricted_subuser_access` property to `true` to constrain the Teammate so that they can operate only on behalf of the Subusers to which they are assigned. You will further set the level of access the Teammate has to each Subuser with the `subuser_access` property.",
